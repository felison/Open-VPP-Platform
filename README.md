# Open VPP platform

We see a Virtual Power Plant as a tool to create value for all stakeholders.

So in our opinion the subsequent steps in VPP value creation should 
inform the principal structure of the application. 

Flow of VPP value creation:
  1 Commitment to a specific script or contract
  2 Adjusting and tweaking controls
  3 Execution on assets
  4 Measurement and valuation of results
  5 Fulfillment and settlement of contract

That principal flow structure should then be reflected in:
- the layout of sthe cripts or (quasi) smart contracts.
- the layout of the runtime flow and modules that process the contracts.
- the layout of the dashboard control elements and reporting visuals.

So each stakeholder can step by step follow the creation of value.

In that respect this tiny experimental demo may stand as a reference model.

# Open VPP platform

We see a Virtual Power Plant as a tool to create value for all stakeholders.

So in our opinion the subsequent steps in VPP value creation should 
inform the principal structure of the application. 

That principal structure should then be reflected in:
- the layout and setup of scripts or (quasi) smart contracts.
- the layout of the flow and modules that process contracts.
- the layout of the dashboard pages and dashboard sections.

So each stakeholder can transparently and step by step follow the creation of value.

In that respect this tiny experimental demo may stand as a reference model.

You can download the files flow------.json and import them in Node-RED
